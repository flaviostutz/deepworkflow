# agentme-edr-policy-019: AI agents development standards

## Context and Problem Statement

AI applications often need to give LLMs the ability to autonomously choose and invoke tools to accomplish tasks. Without standardized patterns for agent implementation, projects end up with incompatible approaches to tool definition, state management, and runtime environments.

Which framework should be used for building agents with tool-invocation loops, and what are the essential patterns for agent state, tools, and execution environments?

## Decision Outcome

**Use the deepagents framework for all agent implementations where an LLM autonomously decides which tools to call and when to stop.**

### Conceptual model

An **Agent** is an LLM-based flow driven by a tool-invocation loop that the LLM itself plans and executes. The LLM decides which tools to call and when to stop. The agent follows a perceive → plan → act → observe cycle autonomously until it reaches a terminal state.

### Details

#### 01-agent-framework

All agent implementations MUST use the **deepagents** framework.

- Use deepagents whenever the LLM needs to autonomously select and invoke tools to accomplish a task.
- The agent MUST follow the perceive → plan → act → observe cycle where the LLM observes tool outputs and decides the next action.
- All LLM calls within agents MUST follow [agentme-edr-018](018-ai-llm-development-standards.md) for LangChain configuration and observability.

**When to use agents vs workflows:**

- Use an **agent** when the LLM should autonomously decide the sequence of tool calls based on runtime observations.
- Use a **workflow** when the execution path is predefined in code, even if individual nodes involve LLM calls or agent subgraphs.
- When in doubt, prefer workflows (explicit control flow) over agents (autonomous control flow) for maintainability and predictability.

#### 02-local-sandbox

When an agent requires a **local sandbox** — an isolated environment where the agent can read files, glob-search directories, and execute shell commands — use the **[deepagents](https://github.com/deepagents/deepagents) framework** to provide that sandbox.

**When to apply this rule:**

Use deepagents sandbox whenever ANY of the following is true:
- The agent needs to execute shell commands or scripts in a controlled environment.
- The agent needs to list, read, or search files across multiple directories at runtime.
- The agent operates on user-supplied or generated file trees that must not escape a sandboxed boundary.

**Integration requirements:**

- Initialize the sandbox at the start of the agent run and shut it down in the same `try/finally` block.
- Pass the sandbox handle into the agent's state so all tool calls share the same sandbox instance.
- If the host-side code needs to pass files into the sandbox (e.g. generated config or input data), create a temporary directory with `tempfile.mkdtemp()`, write the files there, and mount it into the sandbox. Clean it up in the `finally` block.
- Replace hand-rolled `read_file`, `search_files`, and `grep_file` tool implementations with the equivalent tools provided by deepagents.

**Example:**

```python
import tempfile
from deepagents import Sandbox

def run_file_analysis_agent(input_files: List[Path]) -> AnalysisResult:
    tmp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    try:
        # Copy input files to temp directory
        for f in input_files:
            shutil.copy(f, tmp_dir)
        
        # Initialize sandbox with mounted directory
        sandbox = Sandbox(mount_paths={tmp_dir: "/workspace"})
        
        # Run agent with sandbox
        agent = FileAnalysisAgent(sandbox=sandbox)
        result = agent.run()
        
        return result
    finally:
        sandbox.shutdown()
        shutil.rmtree(tmp_dir)
```

#### 03-agent-state-management

**State type naming:**

- Agent state types MUST end with `_agent_state` suffix (e.g., `file_analyzer_agent_state`)
- Follow [agentme-edr-020](020-ai-workflow-development-standards.md) rule `11-state-type-conventions` when agents are used as workflow nodes

#### 04-tool-definition-patterns

Tools provided to agents MUST follow these patterns:

**Tool signature:**

```python
from typing import Any, Dict

def tool_name(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Brief description of what the tool does.
    
    Args:
        arg1: Description of arg1
        arg2: Description of arg2
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with tool execution results
    """
    # Tool implementation
    return {"status": "success", "result": ...}
```

**Tool requirements:**

- Tool names MUST be descriptive action verbs (e.g., `search_files`, `execute_command`, `read_document`)
- Tool docstrings MUST clearly describe the tool's purpose, arguments, and return value (the LLM reads these)
- Tools MUST return structured data (dictionaries or dataclasses), not bare strings or untyped values
- Tools MUST handle errors gracefully and return error information in the result structure, not raise exceptions
- Tools that interact with external systems MUST be placed in `adapters/connectors/` per [agentme-edr-026](026-pragmatic-hexagonal-architecture.md)

**Error handling in tools:**

```python
def search_files(pattern: str, directory: str = ".") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Search for files matching a glob pattern."""
    try:
        matches = list(Path(directory).glob(pattern))
        return {
            "status": "success",
            "matches": [str(m) for m in matches],
            "count": len(matches)
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "error_message": str(e),
            "error_type": type(e).__name__
        }
```

#### 05-agent-error-handling-and-recovery

Agents MUST implement robust error handling:

**Maximum iteration limits:**

- Every agent MUST have a maximum iteration limit to prevent infinite loops
- The default maximum SHOULD be configurable and logged when reached
- When the maximum is reached, the agent MUST return a structured failure result, not raise an exception

**Tool failure handling:**

- When a tool returns an error, the agent MUST be able to observe the error and decide on recovery actions
- Tools MUST NOT raise exceptions for expected failures (network errors, file not found, etc.)
- Agents MAY implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures

**Terminal states:**

Agents MUST recognize and handle three terminal states:
- **Success**: Goal achieved, task complete
- **Failure**: Goal cannot be achieved, give up gracefully
- **Timeout**: Maximum iterations reached, return partial results if possible

#### 06-agent-naming-conventions

Agent class names MUST follow the pattern `<Purpose>Agent` where `<Purpose>` describes what the agent does:

**Good names:**
- `FileAnalyzerAgent` — analyzes files
- `CodeReviewerAgent` — reviews code
- `DataExtractorAgent` — extracts data from documents

**Bad names (FORBIDDEN):**
- `Agent` (too generic)
- `MainAgent` (not descriptive)
- `MyAgent` (not descriptive)
- `Agent1` (numbered, not semantic)

When agents are used as nodes in workflows, the node name MUST use the `_agent` suffix per [agentme-edr-020](020-ai-workflow-development-standards.md) rule `09-node-naming-conventions`.

#### 07-agent-observability

Agent execution MUST be observable through logging and tracing:

- Log each iteration of the perceive → plan → act → observe cycle with iteration number and tool selection.
- Use structured logging (JSON) with fields: `iteration`, `tool_selected`, `tool_result_status`, `decision`.
- For LLM calls within agents, follow [agentme-edr-018](018-ai-llm-development-standards.md) rule `03-llm-observability`.
- When agents run as workflow nodes, MLflow tracking from the parent workflow automatically captures agent-level traces.

**Example structured log entry:**

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-06-05T10:30:45Z",
  "agent": "FileAnalyzerAgent",
  "iteration": 3,
  "tool_selected": "search_files",
  "tool_args": {"pattern": "*.py"},
  "tool_result_status": "success",
  "decision": "continue"
}
```

#### 08-agent-unit-testing

Agent LLM calls are external API calls and MUST be mocked in unit tests per [agentme-edr-018](018-ai-llm-development-standards.md) rule `04-unit-test-mocking`.

Because agents drive a tool-invocation loop — where the LLM decides which tools to call — the fake model must return **tool-call messages** followed by a final answer. Use **`GenericFakeChatModel`** for this:

```python
from langchain_core.language_models.fake_chat_models import GenericFakeChatModel
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage

def test_file_analyzer_agent_calls_search_then_stops():
    # Iteration 1: LLM requests a tool call
    tool_call_msg = AIMessage(
        content="",
        tool_calls=[{
            "name": "search_files",
            "args": {"pattern": "*.py", "directory": "/workspace"},
            "id": "call_1"
        }]
    )
    # Iteration 2: LLM produces a final answer after observing the tool result
    final_msg = AIMessage(content="Found 3 Python files matching the pattern.")

    fake_model = GenericFakeChatModel(messages=iter([tool_call_msg, final_msg]))

    agent = FileAnalyzerAgent(model=fake_model)
    result = agent.run(directory="/workspace")

    assert result.status == "success"
    assert "3 Python files" in result.summary
```

Agents MUST be designed so that the LLM instance is injectable (constructor parameter) to allow test doubles. See [agentme-edr-018](018-ai-llm-development-standards.md) rule `04-unit-test-mocking` for the injectable LLM pattern.

**`mock_deep_agent`**

Place `mock_deep_agent` in a shared test utilities module (e.g., `tests/helpers.py`) so all test files that need it can import it from one location and mock deep_agent instances when needed.

**Example usage:**

```python
from tests.helpers import mock_deep_agent

def test_workflow_calls_subagent(mocker):
    mock_deep_agent(
        mocker,
        "mypackage.nodes.analysis_node.create_workflow_agent",
        output={"status": "success", "findings": ["issue A"]}
    )

    result = run_analysis_workflow(input_data)

    assert result.findings == ["issue A"]
```

#### 09-agent-composition

When multiple agents are needed:

- **Single agent with multiple tools:** Use when tools share a common goal and context (e.g., a code analysis agent with `read_file`, `search_code`, and `analyze_pattern` tools).
- **Multiple agents as workflow nodes:** Use when agents have distinct responsibilities and outputs that feed into each other. Orchestrate them using LangGraph per [agentme-edr-020](020-ai-workflow-development-standards.md).
- Do NOT create nested agent loops (agent calling agent autonomously). Use workflows for multi-agent orchestration.

**Decision criteria:**

| Pattern | When to use |
|---|---|
| Single agent + tools | All tools serve the same goal; agent completes in one session |
| Multiple workflow-orchestrated agents | Each agent has a distinct goal; outputs flow between agents; deterministic sequencing needed |
| Nested agents (FORBIDDEN) | Never — always use workflow orchestration instead |
